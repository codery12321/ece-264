## Homework for ECE 264 Fall 2021 at Purdue University
Written by Yolanda Chen

**hw0**: setup github
**hw1**: Cake - walks over an array to figure out who gets the cake
**hw2**: Structures - create new data types using struct, pass arguments of the new type, understand the difference between passing a structure object and passing a pointer to a structure object, integrate a function in a range, write a Makefile
**hw3**: Function Pointers - Create a type for functions that have the same types of arguments and return value, make a structure with an attribute as a function pointer, write a function that takes a pointer to this structure (modified from HW2), write a function that integrates multiple functions, read data from a file and write output to another file, detect errors and return proper code ('true', 'false', 'EXIT_SUCCESS', or EXIT_FAILURE), write Makefile to test
**hw4**: QSort - Count the number of integers in a file, allocate memory (an array) to store the integers, read integers from the file and store them in the array, call qsort function to sort the integers, release memory, check memory error using valgrind, write the sorted array to another file
**hw5**: Sorting Student Records - Read unsorted data from files, write sorted data to another file, use the C built-in qsort function to sort the data
**hw6**: MergeSort - Recursion principles, "Divide-and-conquer" recursion, merge sort
**hw7**: Card Shuffling using Riffle Shuffling part 1 - Use recursion to solve a problem, make copies of structures using memcpy, and understand the mathematics calculating the number of outputs
**hw8**: Card Shuffling using Riffle Shuffling part 2 - Use recursion to solve a problem., understand how to modify a program (you wrote) for a slightly different problem
**hw9**: Depth First Search - Enumerations and complex data type, 2D arrays, more recursion, depth first search
**hw10**: Who Gets the Cake (Part 2) - Insert and delete nodes in a linked list
**hw11**: Depth First Search and Linked Lists - Building a sorted linked list, incremental development
**hw12**: Reverse Polish Notation Calculator - Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), stacks, using a stack to evaluate RPN expressions
**hw13**: Expression Trees - Basic expression parsing, building a tree bottom-up, performing a post-order traversal of a tree
**hw14**: Huffman Encoding - Binary trees, linked list
